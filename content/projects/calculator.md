Calculator was inspired by the abundance of calculator-oriented projects I saw at the time, as well as the native MacOS calculator. A few of the goals I had for this project were to replicate the appearance and functionality of its inspiration, exercise my ability to break a given process down into smaller, manageable steps, and organize the components of that process in a manner that made the functionality easy to understand. I explored modularization (thanks to IIFEs) and implemented dependency injection (for single use objects) and protoypal inheritence (for multiple use objects), all ofwhich helped to keep things neat. Overall, I believe I achieved my goals.
