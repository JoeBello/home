About myself... I'm the type of person who struggles to define their existence at all, let alone within a brief paragraph on a presentational website. I like to think a lot, about ~~most things~~ everything. Learning is a regular activity for me and includes topics, such as human existence and consciousness, building quality software, and how to repair my home. I enjoy exercising my body as well, so I spend a signficant amount of time being physically active, which includes weightlifting, running, and hiking.
